    This is a little exercise in python that I modified to add a chart with two point displayed on it: the origin point and the highest summit fund point. I'm glad to share with you my work, my research. I know that my code isn't perfect, I'm learning, But it's so important for me to introduce my learning path to you. The initial exercise comes from the AI learning course of Helsinki (link : <a href="https://www.elementsofai.com/">https://www.elementsofai.com</a>) but I add two python libraries (matplotlib and numpy) to display a chart.<br>
    the goal is to reach the high summit from an initial point and move 10 index to the left or 10 index to the right depending of the high value fund. Then I display a graph with red line taking in abscissa the index num and in ordinate the value of index.
